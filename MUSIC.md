[:musical_note:] SOME OF THE MUSIC THAT I ENJOY TO LISTEN  [:musical_note:]

### Oscar Peterson 
| _(added 3march2018)_

"Peterson was born to immigrants from the West Indies; his father worked as a porter for Canadian Pacific Railway. 
His father, Daniel Peterson, an amateur trumpeter and pianist, was one of his first music teachers, and his sister 
Daisy taught young Oscar classical piano. Peterson was persistent at practising scales and classical études daily, 
and developed his virtuosity thanks to such arduous practice.
At the age of nine Peterson played piano with control that impressed professional musicians. 
For many years his piano studies included four to six hours of daily practice" [ [:link:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Peterson)] .

| _(added 3march2018)

These are some interesting facts from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannonball_Adderley)
about him: 
* "His nickname derived from "cannibal", a title imposed on him by high school colleagues as a tribute to his voracious appetite".
* "He had a cerebral hemorrhage and four weeks later, on August 8, 1975, he died at St. Mary Methodist Hospital in Gary, Indiana. He was 46 years old".

Track Listing Recording: 
Tracks 2-3, 7, 9-10 recorded on January 27, 1961; tracks 5 & 6 on February 21; tracks 1, 4 & 8 recorded on March 13, 1961, all at Bell Sound Studios, New York City.

Personnel:   
Cannonball Adderley - Alto saxophone, leader  
Bill Evans - Piano  
Percy Heath - Bass  
Connie Kay - Drums  

> It feels nice to listen to **CANNIBAL**. 



### Horace Silver's Blue Note Years Mix | [:notes:](https://soundcloud.com/gillespeterson/horace-silvers-blue-note-years-mix)

> For the first time, I bumped into an undervalued musician before to listening it at Gilles Peterson' show.
What also surprises me, it is the fact that Gilles created this fabulous tribute mix, on 19 June 2014, 
one day after Horace's death [:link:](http://www.gillespetersonworldwide.com/horace-silver-tribute-mix/),
which, considering it as a irrelevant fact, coincides to the year that I came to the UK, October 2014.

> such a beuatiful piece, Si Señor!

Horace's mother, Gertrude, was from Connecticut; his father, John Tavares Silver, was born on the island of Maio, 
Cape Verde, and emigrated to the United States as a young man. 
She was a maid and sang in a church choir; he worked for a tire company.

> What an incredible sensation to listen to this song, I am not only fascinated with the music and the lyrics but also the variation of facial representations.


During live performances, Sandoval prefers to sing in near-darkness with only a dim backlight, playing the tambourine, harmonica, glockenspiel or shaker.
She has a reputation for shyness. Her stage presence has been described as "idly withdrawn, barely acknowledging the audience."

###  Basebarsovia by Jorge Rugerio ( [twitter](https://twitter.com/jrugerio) | [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jrugeriomx/) )
I have been listening to Jorge Rugerio for quite a while, maybe since 2000.
I just got that vague memory in my adolescence where I recorded some tapes of
rock 101. Then, I just discovered "el gordito de la radio" at
[XHOF-FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHOF-FM), also known as Reactor 105.7,
which plays alternative rock music, and hip hop mainly in English and Spanish.

To listen to Reactor, go to [emisoras](http://www.emisoras.com.mx/#reactor) or
[tunein](https://tunein.com/radio/Reactor-FM-1057-s24573/) to listen REACTOR where 
you can find other interested programs such as: [MariaLaDelRadio](https://twitter.com/marialadelradio),
etc.
