Listen REACTOR at [emisoras](http://www.emisoras.com.mx/#reactor) or
[tunein](https://tunein.com/radio/Reactor-FM-1057-s24573/)

[XHOF-FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHOF-FM), also known as Reactor 105.7,
is a radio station in Mexico City that plays alternative rock music, and hip
hop mainly in English and Spanish.

I have been listeing Jorge Rugerio for quite a while, maybe since 2000 but
in general I started to listen rock 101 and then for some reason I went to
listen Reactor.
