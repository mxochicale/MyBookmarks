> Soul singin and shining goes outward towards the cold and dark.
Soul silent and cold comes inward to the shinning, to the siging at the fire.
Owl flies without sound; coyote goes in darkness; soul  listens and holds still.

### Haggard Eppur Si Muove 

> The album is based on the life of the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei (1564 –1642), who, 
according to legend, muttered the phrase eppur si muove, meaning "And yet it does move", 
after being forced to recant, in front of the Inquisition, 
his belief that the earth moved around the sun. [:link:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eppur_Si_Muove_(album))

### isao tomita

"Tomita started arranging Claude Debussy's impressionist pieces for synthesizer and, in 1974, 
released the album Snowflakes Are Dancing; it became a worldwide success and was responsible 
for popularizing several aspects of synthesizer programming. The album's contents included ambience, 
realistic string simulations, an early attempt to synthesize the sound of a symphony orchestra, 
whistles, and abstract bell-like sounds, as well as a number of processing effects including 
reverberation, phase shifting, flanging, and ring modulation. 
Quadrophonic versions of the album provided a spatial audio effect using four speakers" [:link:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isao_Tomita)

### Oscar Peterson 


"Peterson was born to immigrants from the West Indies; his father worked as a porter for Canadian Pacific Railway. 
His father, Daniel Peterson, an amateur trumpeter and pianist, was one of his first music teachers, and his sister 
Daisy taught young Oscar classical piano. Peterson was persistent at practising scales and classical études daily, 
and developed his virtuosity thanks to such arduous practice.
At the age of nine Peterson played piano with control that impressed professional musicians. 
For many years his piano studies included four to six hours of daily practice" [ [:link:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Peterson)] .

> For the first time, I bumped into an undervalued musician before to listening it at Gilles Peterson' show.
What also surprises me, it is the fact that Gilles created this fabulous tribute mix, on 19 June 2014, 
one day after Horace's death [:link:](http://www.gillespetersonworldwide.com/horace-silver-tribute-mix/),
which, considering it as a irrelevant fact, coincides to the year that I came to the UK, October 2014.

> What an incredible sensation to listen to this song, I am not only fascinated with the music and the lyrics but also the variation of facial representations.


During live performances, Sandoval prefers to sing in near-darkness with only a dim backlight, playing the tambourine, harmonica, glockenspiel or shaker.
She has a reputation for shyness. Her stage presence has been described as "idly withdrawn, barely acknowledging the audience."

###  Basebarsovia by Jorge Rugerio ( [twitter](https://twitter.com/jrugerio) | [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jrugeriomx/) )
I have been listening to Jorge Rugerio for quite a while, maybe since 2000.
I just got that vague memory in my adolescence where I recorded some tapes of
rock 101. Then, I just discovered "el gordito de la radio" at
[XHOF-FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHOF-FM), also known as Reactor 105.7,
which plays alternative rock music, and hip hop mainly in English and Spanish.

To listen to Reactor, go to [emisoras](http://www.emisoras.com.mx/#reactor) or
[tunein](https://tunein.com/radio/Reactor-FM-1057-s24573/) to listen REACTOR where 
you can find other interested programs such as: [MariaLaDelRadio](https://twitter.com/marialadelradio),
etc.
