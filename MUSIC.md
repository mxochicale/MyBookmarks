## RADIO

###  Basebarsovia by Jorge Rugerio ( [twitter](https://twitter.com/jrugerio) | [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jrugeriomx/) )
I have been listening to Jorge Rugerio for quite a while, maybe since 2000.
I just got that vague memory in my adolescence where I recorded some tapes of
rock 101. Then, I just discovered "el gordito de la radio" at
[XHOF-FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHOF-FM), also known as Reactor 105.7,
which plays alternative rock music, and hip hop mainly in English and Spanish.

To listen to Reactor, go to [emisoras](http://www.emisoras.com.mx/#reactor) or
[tunein](https://tunein.com/radio/Reactor-FM-1057-s24573/) to listen REACTOR where 
you can find other interested programs such as: [MariaLaDelRadio](https://twitter.com/marialadelradio),
etc.
